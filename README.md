This project makes the text smaller with each line you input. 

## Format

This is a standard npm create project, with just the App.js modified.

## Ideas for Improvement

Really it should make each successive line smaller, but I wasn't sure how to capture that state in the map function - so I left it like this.

### Credit

Thanks to this codepen for most of its structure - it came from a stack overflow answer about adding text from components to divs that I can't find right now.
